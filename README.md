FaizanSayani-CC-CA2-Activity
This project consists of a React.js front-end application (faizan-app) and a Spring Boot-based back-end split into two modules (Backend-1 and Backend-2). The project is designed to manage student information, including details and registration data, with MongoDB Atlas as the database.

Features
Student Details Page

Displays student details (name, address, phone number).
Back-end handled by Backend-1 (deployed to Render).
Student Registration Page

Enables adding new student data with fields: name, placement status, and CGPA.
Back-end handled by Backend-2 (deployed to Render).
React Front-End (faizan-app)

Front-end app built with React.js to provide an intuitive UI for the above functionalities.
Project Structure
faizan-app/: React.js front-end application.
Backend-1/: Spring Boot application handling student details.
Backend-2/: Spring Boot application handling student registration.
Setup Instructions

cd FaizanSayani-CC-CA2-Activity
Set Up Back-End

Navigate to Backend-1 and Backend-2 folders.
Open application.properties in each folder and update the MongoDB Atlas URI with your credentials:
properties
Copy code
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>
Build and run each back-end module:
bash
Copy code
# Backend-1
cd Backend-1
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Backend-2
cd ../Backend-2
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Set Up Front-End

Navigate to the faizan-app folder:
bash
Copy code
cd ../faizan-app
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React application:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:3000
Deployment
Back-End:

Both Backend-1 and Backend-2 are deployed on Render.
Update the API endpoints in the React app (faizan-app/src) to point to the Render URLs of Backend-1 and Backend-2.
Front-End:

Deploy faizan-app to Netlify or any other hosting platform.

Technologies Used :
Front-End: React.js
Back-End: Spring Boot (Java)
Database: MongoDB Atlas
Hosting Platforms: Render, Netlify (or similar)
Key Notes
Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster is accessible from your back-end services by whitelisting your IP or using 0.0.0.0/0 (not recommended for production).
Modify application.properties in both Backend-1 and Backend-2 to reflect your database configuration.
Make sure to update the API endpoints in faizan-app before deploying the front-end.
